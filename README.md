## üéØ Problem Statement

**Tired of "message too long" errors when working with AI models?** This platform solves the universal challenge of processing large text documents, especially video transcripts, by intelligently breaking them into manageable chunks while preserving context and meaning.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† Smart Chunking Method
- **Context-Aware Splitting**: Uses NLP sentence segmentation and regex-based text preprocessing
- **Human-Readable Output**: Maintains narrative flow and readability
- **Perfect for**: Articles, transcripts, documentation, and content meant for human consumption

### ‚ö° Simple Chunking Method  
- **Predictable Sizing**: Consistent chunk sizes for reliable AI model processing
- **Token-Optimized**: Maximizes space utilization within AI token limits
- **Perfect for**: Structured data, code, and high-speed processing requirements

## üöÄ Live Demo

Experience the platform in action: **[nikhilwebsite-seven.vercel.app](https://nikhilwebsite-seven.vercel.app)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js with modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Axios for API communication
- Responsive design with CSS3

**Backend:**
- Python Flask REST API
- Natural Language Processing with sentence segmentation
- RESTful API design with proper CORS handling

**Infrastructure:**
- Serverless deployment on Vercel
- Cloud-native development practices
- JSON-based data exchange
- Git version control

## üìã Use Cases

### When to Use Smart Method:
- ‚úÖ Content will be read by humans
- ‚úÖ Maintaining context and readability is crucial  
- ‚úÖ Working with narrative text, articles, or video transcripts
- ‚úÖ Quality of chunks matters more than size consistency

### When to Use Simple Method:
- ‚ö° Feeding text directly to AI models with strict token limits
- ‚ö° Need predictable, consistent chunk sizes for batch processing
- ‚ö° Working with structured data, code, or technical documentation
- ‚ö° Processing speed is more important than perfect readability
- ‚ö° Need maximum space utilization and efficiency

## üé¨ Perfect for Video Transcript Processing

This tool excels at handling large video transcripts by:
- Intelligently detecting sentence boundaries using NLP segmentation
- Preserving speaker context and timing information
- Maintaining conversation flow across chunks
- Optimizing text for downstream AI processing tasks like summarization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
Frontend (React.js) ‚Üí REST API ‚Üí Flask Backend ‚Üí NLP Sentence Segmentation ‚Üí Chunked Output
```

The application follows a clean separation of concerns with:
